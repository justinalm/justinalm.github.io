            <p><strong>Valeting your car can be frustrating</strong>—even though it’s a luxury. <strong>You need cash</strong> to pay and tip your valet but society is increasingly cashless. <strong>Waiting is painful</strong>. Before queuing to pickup your car, you spend 5-10 minutes wrangling your kids and belongings. Then you wait outside for another 5-20 minutes in 30 degree heat. Hot climates help valet companies succeed.</p>

            <p><strong>Managing a valet business is difficult</strong>. Often, valet companies operate on <strong>antiquated systems</strong>. I mean, cash only??? Too often payments and tips slip into the valet’s pocket instead of the company bank account. The <strong>company doesn’t have visibility</strong> into their locations to understand who’s working, the number of cars parked at a time, revenue collected, and tips shared.</p>

            <p><strong>We streamlined the management of valet parking</strong> and improved the experience for customers in two key ways: we allowed for <strong>payment on the user’s smartphone</strong> rather than in cash and we created a <strong>virtual line up system</strong>, where users can notify the valet a few minutes in advance of when their car is needed. For the system to work, we built these five elements:</p>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>An identity and brand</strong> to bring consistency across the system.</li>
                <li><strong>A consumer smartphone app</strong> for paying the valet and requesting your car.</li>
                <li><strong>A valet management app</strong> for valets to use.</li>
                <li><strong>A scannable printed ticket</strong> for the customer and valet to scan.</li>
                <li><strong>A hosted online service</strong> to tie the previously mentioned services together and provide the valet companies visibility into transactions.</li>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Identity and brand</h3>
    <p>To kick off the project, I took some time develop Valet65’s identity and brand. I knew that having a clear visual direction for Valet65’s identity would going to pay off as we built out the system. As you can see below, I developed 3 directions for Valet65 to choose from. Valet65 chose the first option because they felt it closely aligned with the tastes of people who valet their car.</p>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <h3><a id=""></a>Architecture</h3>
    <p>Before starting in on any wireframing or visual design, I mapped actions and decisions a person would make to complete goals. This gave me an inventory of design needs.</p>
</div>

    <img style="max-width: 1024px;" src="/assets/steamclock/valet65/information-architecture.jpg" alt="Information architecture detailing user journeys and decisions we needed to design for." />
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p>With this high-level architecture mapped out, I was then able to start wireframing screens. The following is a deep dive into the user experience for the consumer and company apps.</p>
</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto">
    <h3>Consumer app</h3>
    <p><strong>Scanning a ticket</strong><br>We built a QR code scanner into the app. The scanner is the first thing the customer sees when opening the app. To scan a ticket, you hover your phone over a QR code. When the app scans successfully, you are taken to the home view. If the QR code is invalid, we display an error at the top of the screen saying, “The QR code you scanned is invalid.”</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Requesting your car</strong><br>To request your car, tap the “Request Your Car” button on the home view. Allow push notifications from Valet65 and select when you want your car. You’re then taken back to the home view where the “Request Your Car” button now displays an “Arrives in ...” countdown.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Payment</strong><br>The customer can now pay the valet before leaving the table. Tap the “Pay Your Valet” button on the home view, enter your credit card information, and tap submit. After adding a tip, review the total and “Confirm Payment”. When payment is complete, you’re taken back to the home view and the “Pay Your Valet” button displays “Paid”. We integrated Stripe so credit card info is securely stored as well as to speed up future transactions on Valet65.</p>
</div>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>When your car is ready</strong><br>
    The “Arrives in ...” button changes to “Arrived” when your car is ready for pickup.</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Notifications from the valet</strong><br>
    You recieve notifications from the valet when your car is on the way or ready. This way you don’t have to open Valet65 again after you’ve paid and requested your car.</p>

</div>

<div class="mw-700  u-mar-auto  u-mar-b05">
    <p><strong>Scanning another ticket</strong><br>
    The app resets to the QR code scanner after the valet closes out your transaction. You can scan another ticket any time by tapping the “Scan a new ticket” button on the home view.</p>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Company facing app</h3>
    <p>For design of the company facing app, we used stock iOS 7 components because it isn’t customer facing.</p>
    <p><strong>Scanning a ticket</strong><br>After logging into the Valet65 enterprise app, you see the “Cars In Queue”. To add a car to the queue, tap the “+” button and scan the QR code on the ticket. The “Add Details” view appears. Add a note with details about the car.</p>

    <p><strong>Liability check and adding the car to the queue</strong><br>After doing some beta testing with Skyline Valet—a Vancouver valet company—we added a “Liability Check” feature. This is a 1-tap way for the valet to be protected from any liability while the car is parked. Tap “Done” and the car is added to the “Cars In Queue”.</p>

    <h3><a id=""></a>Scannable printed ticket</h3>
    <p><strong>Production details</strong><br>Valet tickets were printed using variable data printing. Woah! Big words, eh? Essentially, this meant we could dynamically generate new QR codes for the tickets, which pointed to the “digital ticket” on the Valet65 servers.</p>
    <p>We designed the tickets to be slightly oversized—2.75" (W) x 7" (H)—so customers could easily find their stub burried deep in their purse. The ticket had 2 horizontal perforations for easy separation. The valet keeps the top half and customer keeps bottom half, which includes liability info.</p>

    <p><strong>URL structure for QR codes</strong><br>
    We had to make sure our system for generating the QR codes could scale as the service scaled. We knew the tickets were going to be printed in batches for the valet companies. We also knew the company ID number on the ticket wouldn’t change but the individual ticket number would change. Infront of the ticket number, we inserted 8 digit random numbers and characters inserted into the URL. Without this a hacker could request someone’s car by generating a QR Code on the internet.</p>

    <h2><a id=""></a>Reflection</h2>
    <p>I really enjoyed working on this project because it covered a lot of territory. There wa interaction between a customer and valet, connected by a printed ticket, two separate iOS apps, and web service, made for a lot of complexity.</p>
